                    <p>My name is John Gotheridge. I was born to a fantastic family and raised in a suburb of Chicago. I decided to move out to Orlando to go to the University of Central Florida.
                        I graduated in 2018 with a degree in Interdisciplary Studies.  This degree was a way for me to build a degree to any specifications I wanted with 75% of two different majors and a minor.  
                        I decided to make my focuses Psychology and Philosophy with a minor in teaching.  I did this as a way try to understand how and why people think.  I have used my degree to work in a few different
                        special needs schools.  During my time in school, I found myself falling into a different career.  I found a real passion for technical landscaping on golf courses.  There was a simplicity and peace 
                        in trying to do simple jobs in perfect order.  I also found a true passion in myself for taking something in chaos and finding the order in it. Recently, I wanted a switch in careers.  My body was taking a toll 
                        from working labor as well as from working in schools.  I wanted a job that was more mentally difficult, but less physically demanding.  That is when I enrolled in a full stack development bootcamp at the 
                        University of Central Florida. Fun life fact, I got married in late 2022.  Enjoy a picture from the wedding of my wife and I!
