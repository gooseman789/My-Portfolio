# My-Portfolio

![Alt text](<assets/My Portfolio.gif>)

## Description

- My motivation for making this project was to better understand how to make a website from scratch.  
- I made this to show the different ways to format and change a website.  I also made this to have a portfolio that I am able to show different companies. 
- This solves my issues by giving me a direct guide of the different options I have as well as a direct thing to show hiring managers.
- The largest thing I learned from this project is how to correctly set up and use flexboxes.  

## Installation

I started this code by filling out the basics of the html file.  I then spent a few different uploads working on the css page.  I then went back and added more content into my html file. I am doing another upload for this readme file.  I also planning on doing two more uploads after posting this.  I want to do an upload cleaning up the CSS file as well another upload fixing the media share.   


## Usage

The usage for this website will mostly for referencing purposes for any hiring manager that is trying to hire me.  

## Credits

The code that I manipulated for this project was found from the gitlab repository named UCF-VIRT-FSF-PT-08-2023-U-LOLC. 

## License

I used the MIT license.
